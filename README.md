# MultiModal_RAG

This project is a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that enhances large language model (LLM) capabilities by integrating both textual and visual data. It retrieves relevant information from a custom knowledge base and feeds it into an LLM for more accurate and context-aware responses.

## Overview

The core idea behind this project is to enhance the performance of LLMs by augmenting their responses with relevant external knowledge, including both textual and visual data. This is useful for tasks that require contextual grounding, factual accuracy, or multimodal reasoning.

## Contents

- `Multimodal_RAG.ipynb`: The main notebook that demonstrates the implementation of the multimodal RAG pipeline.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Features

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- Multimodal input support (e.g., CLIP or similar for images)
- Knowledge retrieval using a local or vector database
- Demonstration through a single, self-contained notebook
